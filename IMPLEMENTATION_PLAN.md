### ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Gaps (Updated)

1. **LLM Configuration**: Default URL is localhost:1234, but your server is at 172.29.96.1:1234
2. **Test Coverage**: Limited integration tests with real repositories
3. **Async Inconsistency**: Mixed async/sync boundaries (minor)
4. **Documentation**: Some redundant planning documents still exist

## Priority 1: LLM Configuration Fix (Immediate)

### Problem
The LLM integration is configured for localhost:1234, but your server is running at 172.29.96.1:1234.

### Solution
Update the default LLM configuration to use your server:

```yaml
# In ~/.repo-doctor/config.yaml
integrations:
  llm:
    enabled: true
    base_url: http://172.29.96.1:1234/v1
    model: qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507
```

Or use CLI override:
```bash
repo-doctor check <repo> --enable-llm --llm-url http://172.29.96.1:1234/v1
```

## Priority 2: Documentation Consolidation (Week 1)

### Problem
Multiple overlapping documents causing maintenance burden and confusion:
- IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (redundant with this document)
- LLM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (redundant with LLM_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md)
- Various thoughts*.md files with scattered insights

### Solution
1. **Delete redundant documents**:
   - Remove IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   - Remove LLM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - Archive thoughts*.md files into docs/archive/

2. **Maintain focused documents**:
   - **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (this file): Master planning document
   - **CODEBASE_ALIGNMENT_ASSESSMENT.md**: Current state analysis
   - **docs/LLM_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md**: Detailed LLM roadmap (referenced below)
   - **CLAUDE.md**: Development guidance for AI assistants
   - **README.md**: User-facing documentation

3. **Update references**: Ensure all remaining documents reference this master plan

    # Split dependencies intelligently for optimal performance
```

#### Phase 3.3: System Detection Enhancement
```python
# Extend repo_doctor/utils/system.py
class SystemDetector:
    @staticmethod
    def get_micromamba_info() -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Detect micromamba installation and capabilities"""

# New module: repo_doctor/cache/github_cache.py
class GitHubCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl: int = 3600):
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = ttl
    
    async def get_or_fetch(self, repo_url: str) -> RepositoryInfo:
        """Cache GitHub API responses to reduce latency"""
```

#### Phase 4.2: Agent Parallelization
```python
# Modify CLI to run agents in parallel where possible
async def _check_async():
    # Run Profile and initial Analysis in parallel
    profile_task = asyncio.create_task(profile_agent.profile())
    analysis_prep = asyncio.create_task(analysis_agent.prepare(repo_url))
    
    profile, prep = await asyncio.gather(profile_task, analysis_prep)
    # Continue with dependent operations
```

#### Phase 4.3: Fast Path for Known Repositories
```python
# Add to KnowledgeBase
def has_recent_analysis(self, repo_url: str, max_age_days: int = 7) -> bool:
    """Check if repository was recently analyzed"""
    
def get_cached_resolution(self, repo_url: str) -> Optional[Resolution]:
    """Return cached resolution for recently analyzed repos"""
```

#### STREAM B Key Files to Work On
- `repo_doctor/cache/` (new directory)
- `repo_doctor/agents/` (optimization)
- `tests/test_real_repositories.py` (new)
- `repo_doctor/cli.py` (simplification)
- `repo_doctor/utils/` (logging, type hints)
```

## Priority 5: Testing Enhancement (Week 14)

### Integration Test Suite
```python
# New test file: tests/test_real_repositories.py
class TestRealRepositories:
    """Integration tests with actual ML repositories"""
    
    REPOSITORIES = [
        "huggingface/transformers",
        "pytorch/pytorch",
        "tensorflow/tensorflow",
        "openai/whisper",
        "CompVis/stable-diffusion"
    ]
    
    async def test_end_to_end_analysis(self):
        """Test complete analysis workflow on real repos"""
    
    async def test_environment_generation(self):
        """Test that generated environments actually work"""
```

### Benchmark Suite
```python
# New module: benchmarks/performance.py
class PerformanceBenchmark:
    def benchmark_analysis_speed(self):
        """Measure analysis speed across different repository sizes"""
    
    def benchmark_memory_usage(self):
        """Track memory consumption during analysis"""
    
    def benchmark_accuracy(self):
        """Measure accuracy of dependency detection"""
```

## Priority 6: Configuration Simplification (Week 15)

### Simplified Default Configuration
```yaml
# ~/.repo-doctor/config.yaml (new defaults)

  validation: true
  cache_ttl: 604800
```

### CLI Simplification
```bash
# Simple mode (default)
repo-doctor check <repo_url>

# Advanced mode (opt-in)
repo-doctor check <repo_url> --advanced --strategy docker --gpu-mode strict
```

### Preset Profiles
```python
# New module: repo_doctor/presets.py
PRESETS = {
    "ml-research": {
        "strategy": "conda",
        "gpu_mode": "flexible",
        "validation": False
    },
    "production": {
        "strategy": "docker",
