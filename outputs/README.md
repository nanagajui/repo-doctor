# Outputs Directory

This directory contains generated outputs from Repo Doctor analyses.

## Purpose

The `outputs/` directory serves as the default location for all files generated by Repo Doctor when no specific output directory is provided. This includes:

- Generated Dockerfiles
- Docker Compose files
- Setup scripts
- Setup instructions
- Environment configurations
- Validation results

## Structure

```
outputs/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── {repo-name}/                 # Repository-specific outputs
│   ├── Dockerfile              # Generated Dockerfile
│   ├── docker-compose.yml      # Generated Docker Compose file
│   ├── setup.sh                # Generated setup script
│   ├── SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md   # Generated setup instructions
│   └── validation_results.json # Validation results (if validation enabled)
└── .gitkeep                    # Keep directory in git
```

## Usage

### Default Behavior
When running Repo Doctor without specifying an output directory:
```bash
repo-doctor check https://github.com/owner/repo
```
Files will be generated in `outputs/{repo-name}/`

### Custom Output Directory
To specify a custom output location:
```bash
repo-doctor check https://github.com/owner/repo --output ./my-env/
```

### Cleanup
To clean up generated outputs:
```bash
rm -rf outputs/*/
```

## File Descriptions

- **Dockerfile**: Container definition for the repository
- **docker-compose.yml**: Multi-container orchestration with GPU support
- **setup.sh**: Automated setup script for the environment
- **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting
- **validation_results.json**: Results from container validation (if enabled)

## Notes

- This directory is tracked in git but individual output files are ignored
- Each repository gets its own subdirectory to avoid conflicts
- Generated files are overwritten on subsequent runs for the same repository
